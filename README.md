# VAMIN

Our team implemented an effective system to detect forest fires with the help of sensors and warn firefighters in time about firehazards that are about to happen when a small fire just broke out. The system consists of both software and hardware.

# Hardware Components
 - Arduino UNO, 
 - Temperature & Humidity sensor, 
 - Carbon Monoxide Sensor and 
 - a power source (a rechargable battery or a small solar panel attached to the mechanism). 
 
More sensors can be attached if wanted (ex Air Flow Sensor)

# Software Features

 - receiving metrics of 3-4 variables 
 - showing them on the user's monitor in form of raw data. 
 - visualizing the data in forms of useful and easy undertantable diagrams 
 - sending a warning of a fire break-out and its location to the user when an abnormal situation accures.  

The system was tested in a small area of Attica in Greece in order to varify its utility and accuracy.

### Open-Source APIs

The system uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [istSOS] - (Istituto Scienze della Terra Sensor Observation Service) is an implementation of the Sensor Observation Service standard from Open Geospatial Consortium

And of course VAMIN itself is open source with a [public repository] on GitHub.
